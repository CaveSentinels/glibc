/*
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T is the word-size used for internal bookkeeping
  of chunk sizes.

  The default version is the same as size_t.

  While not strictly necessary, it is best to define this as an
  unsigned type, even if size_t is a signed type. This may avoid some
  artificial size limitations on some systems.

  On a 64-bit machine, you may be able to reduce malloc overhead by
  defining INTERNAL_SIZE_T to be a 32 bit `unsigned int' at the
  expense of not being able to handle more than 2^32 of malloced
  space. If this limitation is acceptable, you are encouraged to set
  this unless you are on a platform requiring 16byte alignments. In
  this case the alignment requirements turn out to negate any
  potential advantages of decreasing size_t word size.

  Implementors: Beware of the possible combinations of:
     - INTERNAL_SIZE_T might be signed or unsigned, might be 32 or 64 bits,
       and might be the same width as int or as long
     - size_t might have different width and signedness as INTERNAL_SIZE_T
     - int and long might be 32 or 64 bits, and might be the same width
  To deal with this, most comparisons and difference computations
  among INTERNAL_SIZE_Ts should cast them to unsigned long, being
  aware of the fact that casting an unsigned int to a wider long does
  not sign-extend. (This also makes checking for negative numbers
  awkward.) Some of these casts result in harmless compiler warnings
  on some systems.
